## Requirements :

- The `pyserial` module installed (you can install it using pip: `pip install pyserial`)
- A SIM800C module connected to a USB port on your computer

<sub>Make sure the SIM800C module is properly connected and configured before running the script. Also, ensure that the correct serial port used for the SIM800C module is set in the script.</sub>


## Usage :

1. Download the repository to your computer by entering the following command in a command prompt or terminal window:

       git clone https://github.com/uruzFR/module-sim800c.git
2. Navigate to the directory.
       
       cd module-sim800c
4. Connect the SIM800C module to a USB port on your computer.
5. Open the Python script in a text editor and modify any necessary information (e.g. PIN code, phone number).
6. In the command prompt or terminal window, enter the following command to run the Python script: 

       python name-of-the-scrip.py
       
   *Before using the other scripts, it is important to execute the configuration scripts (in configuration directory). 
    After running the configuration scripts, you can modify the other scripts with your own information and use them as needed.*       
       
6. Enjoy.

## Info :

1. Show TTY

       dmesg | grep tty
2. If you encounter an error, I recommend that you remove Brltty.

       sudo apt remove brltty
